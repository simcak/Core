# Scripts README

Scripts are useful for automating repetitive tasks, simplifying complex commands, and improving productivity. They help you execute a series of commands quickly and consistently.

## How to Use Scripts

1. Make the script executable:
	```bash
	chmod +x <script.sh>
	```
2. Run the script:
	```bash
	./<script.sh>
	```
Replace `<script.sh>` with the name of your script file.

## Our Scripts
- `ggg.sh`: A function that goes into the `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.
- `fix-commit-history.sh`: A script to fix the commit history by fixing the email address from school email to personal/github email.
